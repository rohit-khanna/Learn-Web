2.  `babel-node spec/run.test.js` or `npm run test`

####  Steps to Run
1. Run the **Mock Server** : [Can be Taken out and Deployed Separately] - internally uses `json-server` module.  
    - use command line to navigate : **backend/services/mock-db-server** 
    - make sure `db.json`  is present
    - run `npm start`
    - now Db Server will be available at endpoint: http://localhost:3000/products

2. Run `npm run build`  to build SASS files into css
3. Run `webpack` to bundle all JS files into one.
4. Open **index.html** and use the cart...
